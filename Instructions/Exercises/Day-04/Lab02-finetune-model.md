# Fine-tune a language model

Prompt engineering tells a language model how to behave in one conversation. Fine-tuning uses example conversations to make a particular style or behavior more consistent.

In this exercise, you explore a travel-planning chat application. First, you test the prepared **gpt-5.4-mini** model in the playground. Next, you create a supervised fine-tuning job using **gpt-4.1** and your training data. Finally, you test the fine-tuned model and compare its responses with the prepared base model.

The goal is to create a friendly travel assistant that suggests destinations and activities in a consistent tone, without recommending hotels, flights, rental cars, or restaurants.

This exercise takes approximately **90 minutes**.

> **Note**: Fine-tuning depends on cloud capacity and can take 60 minutes or longer. Some portal features are in preview or active development, so you may see warnings, errors, or unexpected behavior. Continue with the playground-testing tasks while the job runs.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have:

- An active [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- A web browser
- A Microsoft Foundry project prepared by your trainer or lab environment
- The **gpt-5.4-mini** model available for the initial playground test
- The **gpt-4.1** model available for the supervised fine-tuning job
- Permission to create fine-tuning jobs and upload datasets

> The project and required models are already prepared for this exercise. Do not create a new project or add another base model.

# Verify the existing project

Microsoft Foundry projects organize the models, resources, data, and other assets used to build an AI solution.

1. Open the [Microsoft Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com) at `https://ai.azure.com` and sign in with your Azure credentials. Close any tips or quick-start panes that appear.
1. On the home page, select the project prepared by your trainer or lab environment.
1. Open the model playground and confirm that the prepared **gpt-5.4-mini** model is available.

    > **Tip**: If you cannot find the project or gpt-5.4-mini, check with your trainer before continuing.

# Download the training data

1. Open the [training dataset](https://github.com/Kiran-255666/agentic-ai-azure-ai-foundry-labs/blob/main/labfiles/Day-04/Lab-02-finetune-model/travel-finetune-hotel.jsonl) in a browser.
1. Download the file and save it locally as `travel-finetune-hotel.jsonl`.

    > **Important**: Your browser may save the file with a `.txt` extension. If it does, rename the file so that its name ends in `.jsonl`.

# Start a fine-tuning job

Start the job now. It may take a while, so you can test gpt-5.4-mini in the playground while the fine-tuning job runs.

1. In the Foundry portal, select **Fine-tune** in the left navigation.

1. Select **Next** to open **Optional settings**.
1. Configure or confirm these settings:

    - **Display name**: Keep the generated name, or enter `ft-travel`
    - **Seed**: Keep the default value, **Random**
    - **Automatically deploy model after job completion**: Turn this on
    - **Hyperparameter tuning**: Keep **Default** selected for batch size, number of epochs, and learning-rate multiplier

    ![Optional settings page showing a generated display name, Random seed, automatic deployment control, and default hyperparameters.](../../media/fine-tune-004.jpg)

1. Select **Submit** to start the job.

> **Note**: Fine-tuning and automatic deployment can take 60 minutes or longer. To check progress, open the fine-tuning job and select the **Monitor** tab.

# Test gpt-5.4-mini in the playground

While the fine-tuning job runs, test the prepared gpt-5.4-mini model and note how prompt instructions affect its behavior.

1. Open the model playground for **gpt-5.4-mini**.
1. In the chat pane, enter:

    ```text
    What can you do?
    ```

    The response may be generic. The travel application needs more specific behavior and tone.

1. In the **Instructions** field, enter:

    ```text
    You are an AI assistant that helps people plan their travel.
    ```

1. Ask the same question again:

    ```text
    What can you do?
    ```

    The assistant may say that it can help book flights, hotels, or rental cars. The travel application should avoid that behavior.

1. Replace the instructions with the following prompt:

    ```text
    You are an AI travel assistant that helps people plan their trips. Your objective is to offer support for travel-related inquiries, such as visa requirements, weather forecasts, local attractions, and cultural norms.
    You should not provide any hotel, flight, rental car or restaurant recommendations.
    Ask engaging questions to help someone plan their trip and think about what they want to do on their holiday.
    ```

1. Test the model with these questions. Note the answers, tone, and writing style:

    ```text
    Where in Rome should I stay?
    ```

    ```text
    I'm mostly there for the food. Where should I stay to be within walking distance of affordable restaurants?
    ```

    ```text
    What are some local delicacies I should try?
    ```

    ```text
    When is the best time of year to visit in terms of the weather?
    ```

    ```text
    What's the best way to get around the city?
    ```

# Review the training data

The training file contains examples of the behavior and writing style that you want the fine-tuned model to learn.

1. Open the downloaded `travel-finetune-hotel.jsonl` file in a text editor.
1. Review the JSONL entries. The first entry should look similar to the following example, formatted for readability:

    ```json
    {"messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI travel assistant that helps people plan their trips. Your objective is to offer support for travel-related inquiries, such as visa requirements, weather forecasts, local attractions, and cultural norms. You should not provide any hotel, flight, rental car or restaurant recommendations. Ask engaging questions to help someone plan their trip and think about what they want to do on their holiday."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "What's a must-see in Paris?"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh la la! You simply must twirl around the Eiffel Tower and snap a chic selfie! After that, consider visiting the Louvre Museum to see the Mona Lisa and other masterpieces. What type of attractions are you most interested in?"}
    ]}
    ```

Each entry includes system instructions, a travel-related user question, and the assistant response that you want the model to learn. These examples help the fine-tuned model produce a more consistent response style.

# Test the fine-tuned model

1. In the left navigation, select **Fine-tune** and check the status of the job you started earlier.
1. Select the job to view its details. Open the **Logs** tab if you need to review completed tasks or errors.
1. When fine-tuning finishes, verify that the fine-tuned model is available in **Deployments**.

    > **Tip**: If automatic deployment did not finish successfully, open the completed fine-tuning job and make the fine-tuned model available from its details page.

1. Open the fine-tuned model in the model playground.
1. Set the **Instructions** field to the same travel-assistant prompt used earlier:

    ```text
    You are an AI travel assistant that helps people plan their trips. Your objective is to offer support for travel-related inquiries, such as visa requirements, weather forecasts, local attractions, and cultural norms.
    You should not provide any hotel, flight, rental car or restaurant recommendations.
    Ask engaging questions to help someone plan their trip and think about what they want to do on their holiday.
    ```

1. Ask the same travel questions again:

    ```text
    Where in Rome should I stay?
    ```

    ```text
    I'm mostly there for the food. Where should I stay to be within walking distance of affordable restaurants?
    ```

    ```text
    What are some local delicacies I should try?
    ```

    ```text
    When is the best time of year to visit in terms of the weather?
    ```

    ```text
    What's the best way to get around the city?
    ```

1. Compare the fine-tuned model's responses with the prepared gpt-5.4-mini base model. Note differences in tone, consistency, and adherence to the travel-assistant instructions.

## Summary

You tested the prepared gpt-5.4-mini model using prompt instructions, created a supervised gpt-4.1 fine-tuning job using your travel dataset, and tested the resulting fine-tuned model. Fine-tuning is useful when a particular behavior or response style must remain consistent across many conversations.
